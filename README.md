# Landmark-Detection-Tracking-SLAM-
An implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world


SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.
This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.


Project Instructions:
The project will be broken up into three Python notebooks; the first two are for exploration of provided code, and a review of SLAM architectures.

Notebook 1 : Robot Moving and Sensing

Notebook 2 : Omega and Xi, Constraints

Notebook 3 : Landmark Detection and Tracking
